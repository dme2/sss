Simple Sound System.

A node based audio programming backend. Currently supports CoreAudio and Alsa, more audio backends will be added in the future.

To build on Linux or macos, run the following commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Several example programs will be built and runnable from the build directory.

(a work in progress!)
